# Membrane-models
Membrane models governed by a system of ordinary differential equations to model the depolarisation of cells.
Code implemented in Matlab for FitzHughâ€“Nagumo, Beeler-Reuter, and Luo-Rudy model, which increase in complexity. Details on the ion currents for these models are described in the literature.
The models behaviour can be tested in Matlab for variations to time-step size and membrane parameters before being implemented in the bidomain model.
